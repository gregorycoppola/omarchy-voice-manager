# Keety

A local speech-to-text app in development for an M2 MacBook Pro running ARM
Linux / Omarchy. The first version is a command-line prototype: transcribe a
short WAV, or explicitly record a short microphone clip and print the transcript.

Uses NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 through a community INT8 ONNX conversion and
`onnx-asr`. Inference runs on the CPU. No NVIDIA GPU, cloud transcription,
PyTorch, system package updates, or macOS frameworks are required.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.lock
.venv/bin/python keety.py download
```

Tested dependency versions are in `requirements.lock` (Python 3.14, Linux
aarch64). `requirements.txt` records the direct dependency.
The model download is pinned by revision in `model-manifest.json`; large weight
files are SHA-256 verified. Model files occupy about 639 MiB and stay in ignored
`models/`. Model download and dependency installation require internet access.

## Use

```bash
# A mono, 16-bit PCM, 16 kHz WAV, up to 30 seconds:
.venv/bin/python keety.py transcribe /path/to/clip.wav

# Load the model, then record ten seconds from the default PipeWire microphone:
.venv/bin/python keety.py record --seconds 10
```

Wait for “Speak now” before speaking. Record mode requires `pw-record`, already
installed on this machine. Audio is recorded to a temporary directory and removed
when the command exits normally, errors, or is interrupted with Ctrl+C.
Transcription uses local model files with Hugging Face offline mode enabled;
the program has no audio upload code. Transcripts print to stdout, and timing
and Linux peak process RAM measurements print to stderr. Nothing is pasted into
another application automatically.

The initial prototype reloads the model on each invocation. A persistent model,
push-to-talk shortcut, desktop interface, and longer-recording segmentation are
future work. INT8 can affect accuracy; test your own voice and technical terms.
This prototype limits clips to 30 seconds because longer inputs need segmentation
and can consume substantially more memory.

## Model provenance

- Original model: [NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3)
- Community conversion: [istupakov/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-onnx](https://huggingface.co/istupakov/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-onnx)
- Runtime: [onnx-asr](https://github.com/istupakov/onnx-asr), using ONNX Runtime CPU

The converted model is marked CC BY 4.0 by its publisher. Credit belongs to
NVIDIA for the original model and Ivan Stupakov for the conversion/runtime.
Weights are downloaded separately and are not committed to this repository.
Keety is an independent app, not an NVIDIA product.
